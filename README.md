Following along with the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), in Rust.

An overview of the language can be found [here](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).

In general, I try to follow the book as close as possible conceptually. That said, this is also an exercise in idiomatic Rust and so things can differ greatly from the Java implementation. Namely sum types and pattern matching see heavy use, with a few macro invocations sprinked in as well.
